=head1 NAME

Javascript::Select::Chain - generate arbitrary depth DHTML select pulldowns

=head1 ABSTRACT

This Perl package makes it easy to generate a series of pulldowns
whose content is a function of the selection in the previous pulldown.
It is a Perl API to a Javascript package written by Xin Yang.
His Javascript package is included, but you can consult his website
for information beyond this documentation:

    http://www.yxscripts.com/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It would really help to read over the docs at:

    http://www.yxscripts.com/cs/chainedselects.html

If you read this, then you will have the concepts and vocabulary 
necessary to understand and use this Perl wrapper to his library.

However, I will do my best to explain everything you need to know here.


=head2 selectchain( $model , $options )

C<selectchain()> takes two arguments. C<$model> is a hash reference
with two keys, C<data> and C<listgroupname>. The value of the key
C<listgroupname> is exactly what is referred to in the original
docs. See C<Car1.pm> in the distribution for a sample usage. The value
of the key C<data> is an array reference in which each element
completely represents one pulldown in the chain. Summarily, here is
C<$model> at the highest level:

  {
   data          =>  [ $level1, $level2, $level3 ],
   listgroupname => $listgroupname                  # e.g., 'vehicles'
  }

Now, we go into how C<$level1>, C<$level2>, ... C<$levelN> looks. In
words, each level is an array reference in which each element is an
array reference. The "inner" array reference looks like this:

   [  $list_name, $option_text, $option_value => $next_list_name ]

There is also a final optional argument which indicates that this item
in the pulldown is the default selected one.

Here is a sample level, completely described:

 my $level1 =
  [
   [ "car-makers", "Select a maker", "",         "dummy-list"  ],
   [ "car-makers", "Toyota",         "Toyota",   "Toyota"       ],
   [ "car-makers", "Honda",          "Honda",    "Honda"        ],
   [ "car-makers", "Chrysler",       "Chrysler", "Chrysler", 1  ],
   [ "car-makers", "Dodge",          "Dodge",    "Dodge" ],
   [ "car-makers", "Ford",           "Ford",     "Ford" ]
  ];


C<Car1.pm> in the distro contains a complete example which generates the
3-level hierarchy shown at www.xyscripts.com.


=head2 EXPORT

None by default, C<selectchain> can be exported on request.
